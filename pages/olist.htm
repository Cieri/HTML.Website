				<h2>Gluten-Free at Thatz'a Pizza</h2>
                <p><img src="../images/gf.jpg" class="img-left-align-100"></p>
				<p>Our gluten-free pizzas never leave their tin, so your pizza never touches any surface that could possibly bear traces of gluten. This is one of the biggest challenges pizza shops encounter when trying to offer gluten-free options. The original product may be gluten-free, but through poor practice, the finished product may not be. The stones inside a pizza oven are one of the most common ways a pizza shop can unintentionally cross-contaminate a gluten-free pizza, because the stones have been in constant contact with non-gluten-free pizzas and products throughout the day. Additionally, many pizza shops &ndash; ourselves included &ndash; use a high-gluten flour to make their traditional dough, adding to a gluten-intolerant customer’s risk when poor food-safety practices are followed.</p>
                <p>Gluten is not like bacteria, so heat is not going to kill it like it could with other food hazards like salmonella. This, and the exact nature of gluten, is something we understand very well at Thatz’a Pizza, and we take care to never put your food at risk of cross-contamination.

				<h2>The Thatz'a Pizza Process</h2>
				<ol>
                    <li>Retrieve an individually packaged, gluten-free crust from the freezer</li>
                    <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                        <li>Cut the plastic surrounding the crust with paper-product exclusive scissors</li>
                        <li>Set wrapped, disposable pizza cutter aside and away from the prep table and ovens</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Holding by the bottom and edge of the baking tin, place the crust and tin in the oven</li>
                    <li>After the crust begins to brown, remove it from the oven &ndash; again only touching the baking tin</li>
                    <li>Wash hands and put on gloves</li>
                    <li>Take the crust to the walk-in cooler</li>
                    <li>Use sauce, cheese, and any preferred toppings directly stored in the walk-in</li>
                    <li>Place the gluten-free pizza &ndash; still in its baking tin &ndash; in the oven to finish cooking</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and place the baking tin and the pizza in a box</li>
                    <li>Close the box and tuck the wrapped, disposable pizza cutter in the side</li>
                    
                
                </ol>

				<h2>Zero Cross-Contamination</h2>
                <p><img src="../images/glutenfree.jpg" class="img-left-align-100"></p>
				<p>Cross-contamination is a big problem for restaurants that are trying to jump on the gluten-free trend. Part of that may be a result of a lack of understanding exactly what gluten is or what products may contain it. Our gluten-free pizza crusts come individually wrapped in their own baking tin, accompanied by their own, disposable pizza cutter. In addition to this, the sauce, cheese, and toppings that we use when preparing a gluten-free pizza come immediately from our walk-in cooler, where they have yet to have any contact with other foods. </p>
                <p>To give some background on why this is significant, the products in our walk-in cooler are essentially the backups for what we keep out front. Since the products out front have been touched and used while preparing non-gluten free pizzas, they are considered contaminated. However, the product still in our walk-in has not been touched or handled since it was first prepped &ndash; cut, mixed, cooked, etc. &ndash; and prepping is always done with clean, gloved hands, so these items have had zero contact with anything else. This is what it means to truly offer a gluten-free pizza, and it is something we are proud to present to our customers.</p>
